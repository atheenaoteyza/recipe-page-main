          <span>Beat the eggs:</span
          >In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they

        <ol>
          <span>Heat the pan: </span>
          Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <span>Cook the omelette: </span>
          Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan
          to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <span>Add fillings(optional): </span>
          When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny
          in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the
          omelette.
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <span>Fold and serve: </span>
          As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it
          over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto
          a plate.
        </ol>

        <ol>
          <span>Enjoy: </span>
          Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed. Nutrition
